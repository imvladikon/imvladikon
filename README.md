<h2> Hi</h2>
<p>I'm Vladimir Gurevich, ML/NLP Engineer (IR tasks, such as Semantic Search, Information Extraction tasks, such as NER, Relation Extraction, etc.).</p>
I am also interested in Speech Recognition and in LLMs.

### Works:

* [**`jupyter-notebook-viewer`**](https://github.com/imvladikon/jupyter-notebook-viewer) - Jupyter Notebook Viewer for local files *.ipynb in browser without Jupyter Notebook installation.
* [**`wav2vec2-hebrew`**](https://github.com/imvladikon/wav2vec2-hebrew) - package for speech recognition in Hebrew language using wav2vec2 models that were trained on Hebrew datasets (check out the datasets below). 
* [**`distiller`**](https://github.com/imvladikon/distiller) - distillation TextClassification and TokenClassification models using transformers library with different distillation methods. 

### Models:

* [**`t5-english-ner`**](https://huggingface.co/imvladikon/t5-english-ner) - NER model that based on T5 encoder that was trained on extremely small dataset.
* [**`sentence-transformers-alephbert`**](https://huggingface.co/imvladikon/sentence-transformers-alephbert) - Sentence Transformers model that based on AlephBERT model for sentence similarity tasks.
* [**`het5_small_summarization`**](https://huggingface.co/imvladikon/het5_small_summarization) - mt5-small based summarization model for Hebrew

#### Speech Recognition:
